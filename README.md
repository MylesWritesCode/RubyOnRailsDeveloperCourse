## Overview
Because of the amount of repos I had to set up for my last course, and having to go through merging them all together, I've decided to put all of the rails apps I'll be building into a single repository rather than making 5 or 6 different ones. It should be fine as long as my .gitignore encompasses all of the rails apps, and I initialize just for deployment in their respective folders.

This course is going to be using Heroku and AWS for storage, as well as Stripe for payments. I feel like I already can do all of these things, but it doesn't hurt to learn more about Ruby (while building things like user authentication from scratch) and Rails as a whole.
