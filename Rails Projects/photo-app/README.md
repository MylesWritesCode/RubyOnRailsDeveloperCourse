## Project Overview
This is probably going to turn out kind of like Instagram. I'm really bored with the standard Bootstrap 4 look, so I'm going to focus on styling this to look like an actual production website. We're also going to be using SendGrid or MailGun to send confirmation emails, which is really cool. Another thing that the mockup looks like we need to set up is Stripe for payments, which is something that I've done before, so there shouldn't be too much trouble there.

## Restrictions
Just don't make this look like all the other websites I've made so far. Start off with the navbar and everything else should fall into place. If time allows, also try to figure out how to change devise message alerts. They're neat, but super uggs by default.

## Dependencies

2. Devise
3. Font Awesome
4. SendGrid
5. dotenv
