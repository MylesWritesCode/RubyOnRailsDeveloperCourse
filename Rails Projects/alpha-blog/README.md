## TODO
I'm not planning on doing any of these things, but should I decide to check up on some of the features I've developed in this app, this is a list of things that were bothering me on final deployment.

1. Check why js.erb files don't work in production.
2. Mailing list integration: I've done it before, but it'll be cool to add.
3. Create a proper footer: Maybe with icons and all that jazz.
4. 'Time since' on posts: I've done this with the twitter clone in another course, just kinda want to do it here too.
